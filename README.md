This project implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. Huffman coding efficiently compresses data by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

### **Features**
- **Compression** : Compresses input text files using the Huffman coding algorithm.
- **Decompression** : Decompresses compressed files back to their original form.
- **Symbol Table Generation** : Generates a symbol table used for compression and decompression.

  ### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the source code using your preferred compiler:

### Intermediate Binary File
During the compression process, an intermediate binary file named compressed_file.txt is generated. This file contains the compressed representation of the input text file in seperate file DecompressInfo.txt. You can specify the name and location of this file when running the compression command.
